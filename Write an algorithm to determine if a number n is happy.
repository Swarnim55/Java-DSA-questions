/*Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.*\


class Solution {
public boolean isHappy(int n) 
    {
        int ans = 0;
        int s=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
          ans = n%10;
          s = s + ans*ans;
          n=n/10;
        }
          if(s==1)
          {
              return true;
          }
          else if(s==4)
          {
            return false;
          }
      return isHappy(s);
    }
}
